    "Hi, I'm a student developer who likes breaking things just to figure out how to fix them usually with JavaScript and snacks. I build web apps that try their best to work on the first try (no promises though).",

    "When I'm not coding, I'm either daydreaming startup ideas, lurking on GitHub, or explaining to my friends why 'it works on my machine' is totally valid. I love creating stuff thatâ€™s fun, functional, and maybe a little chaotic.",
